#Help! Why Am I Getting This Communication?

The simple answer? You're listed as a product owner for a project that is currently running on the OpenShift Platform.

#What Does That Mean?

OpenShift is the BC Government's DevOps platform. 

At some point, a team of developers worked (or are working) on a project on this platform, and named you as their product owner.

You should have been involved in the on-boarding process. But things do not always happen as they should. So here we are!

#How Do We Fix This?

Sadly, the platform services team cannot stay informed about the team members on every single one of the hundreds of projects on the platform, 
so, chances are, we don't know who should be the product owner instead of you.

Ask around your branch/division. Chances are, someone knows what the project is, and can either take ownership of it or can tell you who should.

#I Found Someone. What Now?

Now, that person can contact the development team working on your project and ask them to update their namespace annotations.
They'll need to do this for *every* namespace (tools, dev, test and prod) and they need to make sure they change both PO email
and rocketchat handle, or you'll keep getting pinged in future communications.

That's it! 

If you want to make sure that you won't get pinged like this again, head on over to the DevExchange rocketchat 
let the platform services team know that there's been a change so we can update our existing email lists. 
We update regularly regardless, but this will make sure!
