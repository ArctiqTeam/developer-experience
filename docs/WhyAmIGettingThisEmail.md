# Help! Why Am I Getting This Communication?

The simple answer? You're listed as a product owner for a project that is currently running on the OpenShift Platform.

# What Does That Mean?

OpenShift is the BC Government's DevOps platform. 

At some point, a team of developers worked (or are working) on a project on this platform, and named you as their product owner.

You should have been involved in the on-boarding process. But things do not always happen as they should. So here we are!

# How Do We Fix This?

Sadly, the platform services team cannot stay informed about the team members on every single one of the hundreds of projects on the platform, 
so we don't know who should be the product owner instead of you.

Ask around your branch/division. Chances are, someone knows what the project is, and can either take ownership of it or can tell you who should.

# I Found Someone. What Now?

Now you can [open an issue](https://github.com/BCDevOps/devops-requests/issues/new/choose) with the platform services team to have the project
namespaces updated to reflect the appropriate product owner.

You'll need the name of the project set (the dev team can get this for you - it's a random string of 6 characters) and the contact information of the new PO.

The issue template contains more information. If you're still unsure, pop into the #devops-how-to channel on rocketchat and ask!
